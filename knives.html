        <h2>What's in a cut?</h2>
          <p><img src="https://cdn.knifebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/damascus_set__etsy_1.jpg">Although this is still technically a "Kitchen Essential", there is so much that goes into knife use and care that I made this it's own page.  A knife is a chef's most prized possession.  It is the one tool that you can't go without and there is no improvising or replacing the utility of a good chef's knife.  I treat mine like my babies.  My sharp, strong, dangerous-when-used-wrong babies.

        <h3>What type of knife?</h3>
          <p>I know what you're thinking: <i>But Kyle, there's so many differnt kinds of knives out there.  How do I pick one?</i>  To which I say: <i>How do you know my name and how am I reading your thoughts?</i>  Once I figure out what the hell is going on, I'll point you to this little list:
            <ol>
              <li>Chef's knife</li>
              <li>Paring knife</li>
              <li>Serrated or bread knife</li>
              <li>Boning knife</li>
            </ol>
          <p>There are obviously many more, but this is mostly what you will find in store-bought knife block sets.  They are listed in order of use.  You will use a chef's knife more than any other knife on a day to day basis and can serve the purposes of all the other knives on this list.  Paring knives are used for smaller, more intricate cutting.  A bread knife is used for, you guessed it: bread!  And a boning knife is used to remove bones from proteins.  There are specific design elements that go into all of these that make them useful in their individual ways, but first and foremost is the chef's knife.

          <h3>Knife Care</h3>
          <p>If I haven't made this point yet, knives are incredibly important in a kitchen and must be cared for as such.  You should never put a knife in a dishwasher.  Carefully hand wash and dry.  Store with an edge guard or in a block.  ONLY use a knife for cutting.  It is not a can opener!  If you take care of your knife, it will last a lifetime.  Proper honing and sharpening techniques also help keep your knife in great condition:

        <h4>Honing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Honing straightens the fibers in the knife blade. This makes the knife cut with less resistance.</li>
            <li>Honing is done with a honing steel.  You should maintain a specific angle (15 degrees for Japanese knives, 20 degrees for German knives) and draw the blade down the steel, sliding from the rear to the tip of the blade.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div  class="column">
        <h4>Sharpening</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sharpening removes material from the knife.  This will make your knife smaller over time and should only be done when the knife is dull.</li>
            <li>Sharpening is done on a whetstone.  There are different levels of grit to each stone.  You can start with a lower number grit and work your way up until you are satisfied with the sharpness.  Commonly used stones are 1000, 3000, and 6000.  Use the same angle to sharpen as you would to hone.</li>
